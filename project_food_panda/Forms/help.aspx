                        Delivery costs just like delivery time, are determined by each individual restaurant. Usually the ones closer to you will charge a small delivery fee. If a delivery rider has to drive a long way to bring you the food, they can charge a little extra for the service. There are also many restaurants with a free delivery. You can easily check the delivery costs of each restaurant while browsing our website.
